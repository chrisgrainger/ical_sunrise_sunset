# ical_sunrise_sunset

I found the original code at http:\\pdxvr.com\ical_sun.php.  It did almost what I wanted, so a'changing I will go.
I wanted the output to be a daily event with the times of transit in the description, rather than as individual events during the day.  Also, I wanted to include astronomical, nautical, and civil twilight beginning and end times.  I am considering adding zenith time and length of day.
